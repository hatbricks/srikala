  // that's timing-dependent and hard to catch in scripted tests (it depends

  // down near the footer before snapping to the top a moment later.
  // useLayoutEffect runs synchronously before that paint, so the reset
  // happens before anything is shown, eliminating the flash entirely.
  // Lenis tracks scroll position independently of the browser's native
  // scrollY, so a plain window.scrollTo(0, 0) here would also get silently
  // overridden on the next animation frame by Lenis re-asserting its own
  // (still-scrolled-down) position — going through lenis.scrollTo() keeps
  // both in sync. When Lenis isn't running (reduced-motion), plain
  // scrollTo still works fine on its own.

    // in a way Lenis's own scrollTo doesn't always fully override. Setting
